# websocket-chat PoC

TASK

The task is to implement the chat that can broadcast messages between 2 or more different windows as it is shown on the screenshot bellow.
Message should contain username, time and text content.
 

-	Pay attention that you will not receive your own messages from server, you should connect at least 2 different browser windows to it, so that way one will send message and the other will receive it (and vice versa).
-	You can use prompt() to ask user for his name when opening the chat.
